\section{Selection Operator and Absence in the Standard Sector}
\label{sec:selection}

The effective coupling to the substrate can be written schematically as
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}
\;\supset\;
\frac{\varepsilon}{\LamUV^{4}}\,
O_S[\phi](x)\,
O_S[\phi](x')\,
\mathcal{K}_{\mathrm{eff}}(x,x'),
\tag{5.1}
\end{equation}
where $O_S$ is a \textbf{pattern complexity operator}. It is designed so that:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item $O_S$ is local, gauge- and diffeomorphism-invariant in $M$;
  \item it is sensitive to \emph{mesoscopic, structured} configurations but strongly suppressed in homogeneous or thermal states;
  \item the combination in Eq.~(5.1) has engineering dimension four so that $\varepsilon$ is dimensionless.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Seed operator and dimensionality}
\label{sec:selection:seed}

Start from a local, gauge-invariant ``seed'' operator $\mathcal{O}(x)$ built from visible fields and curvature, with mass dimension
$\Delta>4$ (irrelevant in the Wilsonian sense). We then define a
\emph{normalized} operator
\begin{equation}
  O_S(x)
  :=
  \frac{\mathcal{O}(x)}{\Lambda^{\Delta-4}},
  \qquad
  [O_S]=4,
  \quad
  [\varepsilon]=0.
  \tag{5.2}
\end{equation}
Here $\Lambda$ is a fixed UV scale of the visible sector. Choosing $\Delta>4$ makes $\mathcal{O}$ irrelevant in the Wilsonian sense, which provides technical naturalness for a small coupling. However, \emph{we do not rely on RG running to hide the effect from colliders}. The key point is that renormalizing to $[O_S]=4$ removes the energy-dependence from the operator itself; all dimensional analysis is done at the Lagrangian level with fixed $\LamUV$. What \emph{actually} suppresses visible-sector signatures is the state-dependence of $\langle O_S\rangle$ via degeneracy dilution, as explained next. In what follows we only use that $O_S$ is local, gauge- and diffeomorphism-invariant, built from irrelevant operators with $\Delta>4$, and normalized to $[O_S]=4$; its detailed field content is otherwise unconstrained.

\subsection{Degeneracy dilution in homogeneous states}

For homogeneous, periodic, or thermal configurations (collider beams, crystals, near-equilibrium baths) there are many macroscopically equivalent
realizations of any given local pattern. We assume that $O_S$ is constructed so that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item it rewards \emph{unique}, fine-grained matches of a high-complexity pattern in phase space;
  \item configurations with $N$ equivalent placements of the same pattern contribute with amplitudes whose coherent overlap scales as $1/N$.
\end{itemize}
Informally, the pattern signal gets ``diluted'' when it can be realized in many ways. In a cubic lattice with spacing $a$ and volume $V$, the number of equivalent placements scales as $N\sim V/a^3$, and in the thermodynamic limit the effective expectation value obeys
\begin{equation}
  \langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{hom}} \;\propto\; \frac{1}{N} \;\to\; 0
  \qquad (V\to\infty).
  \tag{5.3}
\end{equation}
A simple toy model (see Appendix~\ref{app:degeneracy-toy-model} for details) is a pattern projector acting on a block of $L^3$ sites. The overlap between a plane-wave state and the pattern scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$, so that $| \langle O_S\rangle |^2 \sim 1/N$.
Thus:
\begin{equation}
  \langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{thermal / periodic}} \approx 0,
  \qquad
  \langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{structured}} = \mathcal{O}(1),
  \tag{5.4}
\end{equation}
and the aether-resonance channel is effectively switched off in ordinary homogeneous matter, including standard collider beams and cosmological fluids.

\subsection{Structured states and pattern quality}
\label{sec:selection:structured}

In contrast, in a driven, mesoscopic, pattern-rich system (engineered materials, critical networks, biological tissues, etc.) the pattern encoded by $O_S$
can be realized in only a few places, and its overlap with the actual state can approach unity. We summarize this as
\begin{equation}
  \langle O_S\rangle \;\propto\; \mathcal{Q}\,\tilde{\Delta\Phi},
  \qquad
  0 \le \mathcal{Q} \le 1,
  \tag{5.5}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\mathcal{Q}$ is a dimensionless \emph{pattern quality factor} (introduced more explicitly in Sec.~6), which measures how well the configuration matches the targeted pattern;
  \item $\tilde{\Delta\Phi}$ is a dimensionless free-energy difference associated with driving the system between two nearby macrostates in $S$.
\end{itemize}
The dependence on the structural distance $d_\sigma$ resides in the kernel $\Ksig = \exp[-d_\sigma/\lambda_\sigma]$ (Sec.~7). For large structural separations, $\Ksig\to 0$ and the coupling vanishes even if $\mathcal{Q}$ is high.

\subsection{Explicit example of a local $O_S$}

One convenient class of examples is based on a windowed functional of derivatives and curvature. Let $w_\ell(x)$ be a smooth, compactly supported window of linear size $\ell$, and define
\begin{equation}
  O_S(x)
  =
  \frac{1}{\Lambda^{\Delta-4}}
  \int d^4y\,\sqrt{-g(y)}\,
  w_\ell(x-y)\,
  \mathcal{F}\!\big(
    \nabla\phi(y),\,
    \nabla\nabla\phi(y),\,
    R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}(y)
  \big),
  \tag{5.6}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{F}
  :=
  \sum_{m+n+k=\Delta} c_{mnk}\,
  \big(\nabla\phi\big)^{m}\,
  \big(\nabla\nabla\phi\big)^{n}\,
  \big(R_{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\big)^{k},
  \tag{5.7}
\end{equation}
and coefficients $c_{mnk}$ chosen so that $O_S$ is scalar, gauge-invariant, and UV-soft above its design scale. The window function ensures locality on scales $\lesssim \ell$, while the polynomial structure makes $O_S$ sensitive to higher-order patterns (gradients, curvature, correlations) rather than just local field amplitudes.

Two genericity remarks are important here.  First, for a ``generic''
choice of coefficients $c_{mnk}$ (e.g.\ drawn from a broad, symmetric
distribution subject only to gauge invariance and UV softness), the
operator $O_S$ is highly sensitive to mesoscopic pattern structure but
its expectation value in homogeneous, periodic, or thermal states is
suppressed by degeneracy dilution.  If there are $N\gg 1$ macroscopically
equivalent ways of placing a given pattern inside such a state, then a
typical superposition of those placements yields
$\langle O_S\rangle \sim N^{-1/2}$ or smaller.  In the thermodynamic
limit this drives the quality factor $Q$ to zero.

Second, moving away from homogeneous states does not require fine
tuning of $c_{mnk}$.  Instead, one engineers platforms (Sec.~5.3) in
which the patterns singled out by $O_S$ are realized in only a few
locations with correlated phases (for example, near critical points or
edge-of-chaos regimes in complex networks).  In such states the overlap
with $O_S$ can approach order unity, $Q\sim 1$, while keeping the same
underlying definition of $O_S$.  In this sense the selection operator
is generic at the level of its field content; what is special is the
prepared state of the visible sector. All later constraints on the S-channel depend only on these generic properties of $O_S$---locality, symmetry, and degeneracy dilution---rather than on the particular choice of window function $w_\ell$ or polynomial $F$ in Eq.~(5.6).

\subsection{Why colliders see nothing}

Putting the pieces together, the effective contribution of Eq.~(5.1) to any collider observable schematically scales as
\begin{equation}
  \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{collider}}
  \;\sim\;
  \varepsilon\,
  \langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{in}}\,
  \langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{out}}\,
  K_{\sigma,\mathrm{eff}},
  \tag{5.8}
\end{equation}
where ``in'' and ``out'' denote initial and final states in a high-energy experiment. For realistic beams and final states we expect:
\begin{itemize}
  \item approximate translational and rotational invariance;
  \item rapidly decorrelating phases;
  \item large degeneracy $N$ of equivalent pattern placements.
\end{itemize}
By the degeneracy-dilution argument (spelled out explicitly in the toy
model of Appendix~\ref{app:degeneracy-toy-model}), $\langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{in}}\approx
\langle O_S\rangle_{\mathrm{out}}\approx 0$ in such states, so that collider
cross-sections are suppressed by the \emph{state} rather than by RG
running. The same logic applies to cosmological and astrophysical plasmas that are nearly homogeneous on microscopic scales.

In summary, the selection operator $O_S$ is chosen so that:
\begin{itemize}
  \item it is technically natural and irrelevant in the Wilsonian sense (built from operators with $\Delta>4$ and normalized as in Eq.~(5.2));
  \item it has negligible expectation value in homogeneous, periodic, or thermal states due to degeneracy dilution;
  \item it can attain order-one values only in specially engineered, near-critical, pattern-rich systems, which are precisely the regimes targeted by our proposed experiments in Sec.~13.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Radiative stability and induced operators}

The effective interaction in Eq.~(5.1) is expected to generate additional operators in the
visible sector once loop corrections involving $O_S$ and the mediator are taken into account.
In a UV-complete theory these radiative effects could induce lower-dimension Lorentz-violating
terms in the Standard-Model Lagrangian, potentially subject to very strong bounds.

In the present work we do not attempt a full renormalization-group analysis of the combined
visible+$S$ system. Instead we take a pragmatic effective-field-theory stance: (i) the seed
operators entering $O_S$ have dimension $\Delta>4$ and are technically natural in the usual
Wilsonian sense; (ii) the state-dependent suppression of $\langle O_S\rangle$ in homogeneous or
thermal states (degeneracy dilution) greatly reduces the size of loop diagrams in ordinary
matter and collider environments; and (iii) any residual induced operators must lie within the
existing SME bounds discussed in Sec.~11. Quantifying this suppression in a specific UV model
is an open problem and is therefore listed explicitly as a limitation in Sec.~14. Here we simply
note that, at the level of the effective action used below, we treat the smallness of $\varepsilon$
and typical $Q$ values as phenomenological inputs to be tested experimentally, rather than as
quantities derived from a symmetry principle.
