\section{Conclusion: The Path Forward}

We've presented a \textbf{consistent, falsifiable framework} for FTL communication via substrate-local coupling - ``aether resonance.''

\textbf{What we've shown:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Mathematical consistency:} Action principle, conservation laws, causality proof, momentum-neutrality
\item \textbf{Phenomenological viability:} Compatible with all experiments to date (via anisotropy bounds)
\item \textbf{Falsifiable predictions:} Three concrete experiments with quantitative targets
\item \textbf{Parameter mapping:} Null results $\to$ bounds on ($\varepsilon$, $\lambda_\sigma$, $\mathcal{Q}$, $\omega_0$)
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{The framework unifies:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Discrete substrate dynamics ($T = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$)
\item Emergent spacetime (GR + QM as low-energy limit)
\item Pattern-space coupling ($d_\sigma$, $O_S$, $\Kkernel$)
\item Thermodynamic resource constraints (bitrate bounds)
\item Quantum information (modified Lieb-Robinson)
\item Causality ($T$-monotonicity)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Two possible outcomes:}

\textbf{Scenario 1: Null Results}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\varepsilon \lambda_\sigma \mathcal{Q} < 10^{-12}$ m
\item $\varepsilon \omega_0 \mathcal{Q} < 10^{-8}$ Hz
\item $\varepsilon \mathcal{Q} < 10^{-20}$
\end{itemize}

Still valuable: Constrains substrate models, quantum foundations, emergent gravity.

\textbf{Scenario 2: Positive Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item FTL communication demonstrated
\item Spacetime emergence confirmed
\item New era of physics begins
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Either way, we learn something profound.}

The experiments are at the edge of feasibility. E1 is arguably doable now (reservoir computing is mature). E2 is challenging but within reach (cryo tech advancing rapidly). E3 is ambitious but conceptually straightforward.

\textbf{Call to action:}

If you're:
\begin{itemize}
\item An experimentalist: Consider a proof-of-concept (even E1 at lower sensitivity)
\item A theorist: Explore explicit substrate models, naturalness mechanisms, connection to quantum gravity
\item A funder: This is high-risk, high-reward - exactly what transformative research looks like
\item A skeptic: Perfect! Design better tests, find loopholes, sharpen the predictions
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Final thought:}

For most of human history, we thought space and time were absolute. Einstein showed they're woven together and dynamic.

For the past century, we've thought spacetime is fundamental. Perhaps it's not.

Perhaps, like a computer display rendering a game world, spacetime is the interface - convenient for us, but not what the universe actually runs on underneath.

Aether resonance is a way to peek behind the screen.

Let's find out if there's anything there.
