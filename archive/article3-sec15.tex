\section{Discussion and Implications}

The hypothesis of \textbf{aether resonance} places FTL transfer at the \textbf{substrate level} where it is local in an alternative proximity notion. It enables directed energy and information transfer without conflict with conservation laws, momentum conservation, or observed causality – under strict conditions: \textbf{shared structure (small $d_\sigma$)}, \textbf{coherence/criticality $(Q)$}, and \textbf{paid cost $(\mathcal{K})$}.

By deriving the framework from a \textbf{variational principle} (ensures consistency with GR via $\alpha=1$ and well-defined $(T^{\mu\nu}_S)$), introducing \textbf{momentum-neutrality} (prevents reactionless drive), setting \textbf{$\alpha\equiv1$} (light-speed causal metric response), using \textbf{length units for $d_\sigma$ and $\lambda_\sigma$}, providing \textbf{local S-mediator implementation} (makes S-proximity implementable), presenting a \textbf{modified Lieb-Robinson bound with exponential $d_\sigma$ damping} (quantifies cluster decomposition breaking), providing a \textbf{formal causality proof with anti-telephone rule} (guarantees no loops), and specifying \textbf{multiple-test correction}, we have addressed the critical consistency objections and remaining details.

\textbf{Thermodynamic resource bounds} (bitrate bound) and \textbf{numerical predictions} (including three scenarios for E2) make the framework \textbf{falsifiable}: null results in E1/E2/E3 translate directly to upper bounds on $(\varepsilon, \lambda_\sigma, Q, \omega_0)$. Positive results would open a new class of non-local technologies.

The framework is \textbf{internally coherent} at EFT level and simultaneously \textbf{externally testable} with pre-registered protocols and clear map from null outcomes to parameter bounds. Either sharp limits are obtained — or a reproducible effect with growing evidence through the distance ladder in $(d_\sigma)$. Both outcomes are scientifically valuable.
