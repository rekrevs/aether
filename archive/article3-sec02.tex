\section{Postulates and Formalisms}

(\textbf{Notation hint:} For unified symbols, units, and macros, see \textbf{Appendix F}.)

\subsection{P1. Discrete Dynamics and Global Ordering}

The substrate evolves in discrete steps $(T)$. All causality is \textbf{monotonic in $(T)$}.

\subsection{P2. Two Proximities and a Projection}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{$(M)$}: emergent spacetime with metric $(g_{\mu\nu})$, where ordinary matter moves locally and obeys relativity.
\item \textbf{$(S)$}: pattern space whose points are local data structures; distance $(d_\sigma)$ measures algorithmic (isomorphic) similarity. \textbf{Unit:} $(d_\sigma)$ has \textbf{length dimension} via an embedding scale $(\ell_0)$ that relates algorithmic complexity to physical scale.
\item A projection $(\pi: S \to M)$ specifies where and how a substrate state manifests observably.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{P3. Aether Resonance – Substrate-Locality in $(S)$}

There exists a coupling that, within one tick, allows energy/information flow between $(s, s' \in S)$ with small $(d_\sigma(s,s'))$, independent of $|\pi(s) - \pi(s')|$ in $(M)$.

\subsection{P4. Conservation Laws in $(M\times S)$}

Total energy/information is conserved over the combined dynamics, even though local budgets in $(M)$ may vary via flows in $(S)$.
