\section{Causality Proof: No Paradoxes Allowed}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Core Concept:} We need to rigorously prove that despite FTL in spacetime, there are no time-travel paradoxes.
\end{quote}

\subsection{The Concern}

\textbf{Scenario:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Alice sends a message to Bob faster than light (via aether resonance)
\item Bob, in a different reference frame, sends a reply back to Alice
\item Alice receives the reply before she sent the original message
\item \textbf{Paradox:} Alice could tell herself not to send the message
\end{enumerate}

This is the \textbf{``antitelephone''} or \textbf{``tachyonic antitelephone''} paradox.

\textbf{Why it normally can't happen:}\\
In special relativity, if you allow signals faster than light, different reference frames disagree on the time-ordering of events. What's ``forward in time'' in one frame can be ``backward in time'' in another. This creates paradoxes.

\subsection{Our Protection: The Substrate Clock}

\textbf{Key Idea:} There's an absolute ordering $T$ at the substrate level.

Even though spacetime has no preferred frame (relativity), the substrate does:
\begin{itemize}
\item Universal substrate time $T = 0, 1, 2, \ldots$
\item Foliation scalar $\tau(x)$ that defines ``now'' at the substrate level
\item Every event has both spacetime coordinates $(x^\mu)$ and a substrate timestamp $T$
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The Rule:}\\
Causality flows forward in $T$, always. No exceptions.

\subsection{Formal Proof (Sketch)}

\textbf{Theorem 10.1 (Causal Monotonicity):}\\
Under conditions (i)-(iii):
\begin{itemize}
\item (i) All resonance dynamics is retarded in substrate ordering $T$
\item (ii) Each resonance step requires $\Krate(e) \geq 0$ (costs resources)
\item (iii) $\varepsilon$ is finite (coupling is not infinite)
\end{itemize}

Then: \textbf{There exist no closed causal loops in $(M\times S)$.}

\textbf{Proof Strategy (Category Theory):}

We construct a \textbf{category $\mathcal{C}$} where:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Objects:} Substrate states $s_i$ at different times $T_i$
\item \textbf{Morphisms:} Allowed transitions $f: s_i \to s_j$
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Either local updates in spacetime $M$
  \item Or resonance transfers via substrate $S$
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Define two functors:}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Time functor $T: \mathcal{C} \to (\mathbb{N}, \leq)$}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Maps each state to its substrate time: $T(s_i) = T_i$
   \item Each morphism $f: s_i \to s_j$ must satisfy: $T(s_j) > T(s_i)$ (strict monotonicity)
   \end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Cost functor $\Krate: \mathcal{C} \to (\mathbb{R}_+, +)$}
   \begin{itemize}
   \item Maps each morphism $f$ to its resource cost: $\Krate(f) \geq 0$
   \item Costs add when composing: $\Krate(g \circ f) = \Krate(f) + \Krate(g)$
   \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Proof by Contradiction:}

Assume a closed loop $L$ in spacetime $M$:
\begin{itemize}
\item Events $A \to B \to C \to A$
\item Final step returns to $A$'s past light cone in $M$
\end{itemize}

This would require a morphism chain in the substrate with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Either: $\Sigma \Delta T_i \leq 0$ (going backward in substrate time) $\leftarrow$ \textbf{Forbidden by time functor}
\item Or: $\Sigma \Krate_i < 0$ (negative total cost) $\leftarrow$ \textbf{Forbidden by cost functor (all costs $\geq 0$)}
\end{itemize}

Both are impossible by construction.

\textbf{Therefore:} No closed loops. QED. $\square$

\subsection{The Anti-Telephone Rule}

\textbf{Practical version:}

Resonance transfers are \textbf{only} permitted if:

\begin{equation}
\Delta\tau > 0
\tag{10.1}
\end{equation}

along \textbf{each substep} in the chain.

\textbf{What $\Delta\tau > 0$ means:}\\
The foliation scalar $\tau$ (the substrate's clock field) must increase along the transfer. This is a \textbf{locally testable} condition.

\textbf{How to enforce it experimentally:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Lock your apparatus to the preferred frame (measure $u^\mu$)
\item Compute $\tau$ at sending and receiving events
\item Verify $\tau_{receive} > \tau_{send}$
\item Reject any apparent ``backward'' transfers
\end{itemize}

\emph{Analogy:} Like requiring that all messages have timestamps, and you only accept messages dated later than your current time.

\textbf{Corollary 10.2 (Two-Lab Anti-Telephone):}

Even if Alice and Bob are in relative motion (different four-velocities $U_A^\mu$, $U_B^\mu$), they both measure:

$\Delta\tau > 0$ on \textbf{each substep}

Because $\tau$ is a \textbf{scalar} (same in all frames) and increases monotonically along allowed morphisms.

\textbf{Implication:}\\
No matter how you arrange multiple parties in different reference frames, you can't create a paradox. The substrate clock is ``above'' the spacetime foliation - it provides an absolute ordering that breaks the symmetry responsible for relativity's antitelephone paradox.

\subsection{Why This Works (Intuition)}

\textbf{Standard antitelephone paradox:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relies on relativity having no preferred frame
\item Different frames disagree on time-ordering
\item Allows ``backward'' causal chains from one perspective
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Our resolution:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Add a subtle preferred frame (substrate clock $\tau$)
\item This breaks perfect Lorentz symmetry (but only slightly)
\item Provides an absolute ``arrow of time'' preventing loops
\item Observable physics still looks Lorentz-invariant to excellent approximation (see \S11 on anisotropy bounds)
\end{itemize}

\emph{Metaphor:} Like adding a ``server timestamp'' to an online multiplayer game. Players might experience lag and disagreement about event order on their screens, but the server's authoritative clock prevents inconsistencies.
